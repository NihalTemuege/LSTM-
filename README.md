# Investigating The Effects of Inflation and Inflation Surprise Rate Changes on US Trade Flows Changes Through Exchange Rates:
An LSTM-based Approach to Constructing Inflation Surprise Rate Estimation

This paper aims to examine the effects of inflation and inflation surprise rate changes on US exports and imports with its top 10 trading partners (excluding China for the generalizability of the results by focusing on a more homogenous group of countries, allowing for a clearer understanding of the factors affecting US trade without the potential distortion introduced by China's unique situation) via exchange rate by analyzing alterations in exports and imports during two distinct regime periods. The first period termed the "target regime period," spans from April 15, 2002, to August 15, 2012, during which the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains below 2%. The second period labeled the "high inflation period," encompasses the time frame from September 15, 2012, to February 15, 2023, characterized by US CPI exceeding 2%. Drawing insights from the historical context of the United States and relevant studies, this research seeks to estimate how fluctuations in inflation and inflation surprise rate influence the dynamics of trade with these key trading partners.

The main methodology of this study consists of two steps. In the first step of the analysis, the performances of OLS, Vector Autoregressive (VAR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are compared in forecasting US CPI to be used for constructing the inflation surprise rate. In the second stage, the impact of change in inflation and inflation surprise rate on change in US exports and imports is compared in these two periods with panel regression analysis.
